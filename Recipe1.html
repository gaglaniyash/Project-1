    <p>A pancake is a flat, round cake that is made by cooking batter on a hot surface, such as a griddle or frying pan.

    <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter and set it aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and
            salt.</li>

        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract. (Don’t worry if the butter
            solidifies slightly).</li>

        <li>Create a well in the center of your dry ingredients. Pour in the milk mixture and stir gently with a fork
            until the flour is just incorporated. A few small lumps are okay. As the batter sits, it should start to
            bubble.</li>

        <li>Place a large skillet or griddle over medium heat. Sprinkle in a few drops of water to test if it’s ready.
            You want them to dance around a bit and evaporate.</li>

        <li>Brush the skillet with melted butter (this creates crispy edges, but you can skip it if using a quality
            nonstick pan).</li>

        <li>Scoop the batter onto the skillet using a 1/4 cup measure or large cookie scoop, and spread each pancake
            into a 4-inch circle.</li>

        <li>After 1 to 2 minutes, the edges will look dry, and bubbles will form and pop on the surface. Flip the
            pancakes and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes until lightly browned and cooked in the middle.</li>

        <li>Serve immediately with warm syrup, butter, and berries</li>
